# Restaurant Inspections Web App

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in--development-blue.svg) 

## What
This web app shows information about Miami-Dade County's restaurant inspections, using this API: https://github.com/Code-for-Miami/restaurant-inspections-api/ It'll make it easier to find out which eateries make the grade, and which ones are failing inspections. 

#### Status
The prototype is currently being built.

## Why
It can be hard to find out which local restaurants are currently closed due to failed inspections, or which ones are guaranteed to provide a safe, tasty meal. However, Miami-Dade County's Restaurant Inspection website can be hard to use. This web app seeks to provide a simple alternative that works on nearly any device.
